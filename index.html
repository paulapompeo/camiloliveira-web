          I started making shirts because I couldn’t find one I liked. After watching lots of YouTube tutorials, I learned how to make a pattern and sew. The outcome came out well and I decided to expand it and create my own brand.
          My mindset is humble and spontaneous and my brand is about collaboration. I learn with every shirt I make and with the many people whom I meet during every step of its production.
          Every garment I make is hand- made in Italy, produced with end-of-stock fabrics in limited quantities, and once sold out, they will not be reproduced.
