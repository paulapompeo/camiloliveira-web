          I started making shirts because I couldn’t find one I liked. After
          watching lots of YouTube tutorials, I learned how to make a pattern
          and sew. The outcome came out well and I decided to expand it and
          create my own brand.
        </p>
        <p class="modal-content">
          My mindset is humble and spontaneous and my brand is about
          collaboration. I learn with every shirt I make and with the many
          people whom I meet during every step of its production.
          Every garment I make is hand- made in Italy, produced with
          end-of-stock fabrics in limited quantities, and once sold out, they
          will not be reproduced.
